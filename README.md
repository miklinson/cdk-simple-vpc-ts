# VPC for development using Typescript

VPC for development using TypeScript with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Deploy

```
$ npm install -g aws-cdk
$ npm install
#This isn't strictly necessary with the AWS CDKâ€”the Toolkit does it for you so you can't forget. But you can still build manually whenever you want to catch syntax and type errors.
$ npm run build
$ cdk deploy
```

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
